# Dataset Generation

### Generate a Single Dataset

Click on the magic wand ðŸª„ icon on a single question to generate an answer (construct a dataset) for that question:

After generating an answer for the question, the number of answers already generated will be displayed on the right side (a single question can generate multiple answers):

{% hint style="info" %}
Easy DataSet generates answers based on the question + the text block corresponding to the question + domain tags together, to ensure the relevance of the answer to the literature itself.
{% endhint %}

When a reasoning model is selected in the upper right corner, the chain of thought (COT) in the model's reasoning process will be preserved:

You can filter questions with generated answers and questions without generated answers:

### Batch Generate Datasets

You can multi-select or select all questions to batch produce answers:

You can view the progress of batch tasks:

{% hint style="info" %}
When a batch task is in progress, closing or refreshing the current page will interrupt the task. You can open a new page to check the already generated answers in dataset management.
{% endhint %}

### Dataset Generation Configuration

The number of concurrent tasks in Task Settings - Question Generation Settings can still control the maximum number of concurrent tasks for batch dataset generation:

{% hint style="info" %}
The larger the maximum number of concurrent tasks, the faster the dataset generation task, and vice versa. Pay attention to the maximum concurrency limit of the model provider.
{% endhint %}
