# Question Management

{% hint style="info" %}
After question construction is completed, questions can be filtered and revised to improve the quality of subsequent dataset generation.
{% endhint %}

### List View

You can view question names, domain tags associated with questions, and text blocks to which questions belong. You can filter by question and tag names:

Supports editing existing questions and adding custom questions:

### Domain Tree View

You can use the domain tree view to see questions constructed under each domain tag:

{% hint style="info" %}
It is recommended to delete low-quality questions in this module (such as questions irrelevant to the literature's author, annotations, etc.) to avoid constructing low-quality datasets later, and to add custom questions for any missing ones.
{% endhint %}
