# Projects

A project is the smallest work unit in `Easy DataSet`. Each project has its own independent configuration (including dataset generation task configuration, model configuration, etc.), and can process a batch of literature and manage all questions and datasets generated based on this batch of literature.

To create a new project, you only need to input the project name and description, and you can reuse model configurations from other projects.

> The name and description are only used for recording and viewing, and will not affect subsequent dataset generation tasks.
