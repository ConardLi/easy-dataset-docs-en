# Domain Tags

{% hint style="info" %}
After text chunking is completed, the platform will call a large model to automatically establish a domain tag tree based on the literature data.
{% endhint %}

### View Original Directory

Switching to the Domain Tree tab, we can see the domain tree intelligently analyzed by AI based on the literature, as well as the original directory extracted from the literature:

In subsequent tasks of generating questions and datasets, the platform will build based on this domain tree, and map the generated questions and datasets to each domain tag. The domain tree allows each dataset to have global understanding capabilities and reduces the possibility of generating duplicate datasets.

### Edit Domain Tree

If you feel that there are inaccuracies or imperfections in the AI-generated domain tree, you can also directly manually add, modify, or delete tags. It is recommended to confirm the domain tree division more accurately before generating questions.
